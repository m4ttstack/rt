/// Manages the rt daemon as a LaunchAgent registered via SMAppService.

/// The daemon lives at <app>.app/Contents/MacOS/rt and the agent plist
/// at Contents/Library/LaunchAgents/<label>.plist. SMAppService hands off to
/// launchd, which supervises the process (KeepAlive + ThrottleInterval).
/// Because the plist declares AssociatedBundleIdentifiers = the app's own
/// bundle id, TCC attributes the daemon's file accesses to the signed parent
/// app — the user grants Full Disk Access to the app once and the daemon
/// inherits it.
///
/// The label is NOT a compiled literal: prod and dev are the same binary in
/// two bundles, and each owns its own launchd job (`com.mattstack.daemon` /
/// `com.mattstack.daemon.dev`). Both the plist basename and every launchctl
/// invocation derive from Info.plist's MSDaemonLabel (BundleFlavor), so a
/// dev bundle can never register or kickstart the prod job.
