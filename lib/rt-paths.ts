/**
 * Single source of truth for the ~/.mattstack/rt path layout.
 *
 * rt state lives at ~/.mattstack/rt (RT-33 moved it from ~/.rt; RT-46 removed
 * the compat-symlink dependency). Per-repo data lives under
 * ~/.mattstack/rt/repos/<repoName>/ (NOT ~/.mattstack/rt/<repoName>/).
 * Keeping the construction here means there is exactly one place that knows
 * the layout, so a future move is a one-line change and stray `join(RT_DIR,
 * repoName, ...)` callsites can't drift. The source-guard tests
 * (lib/__tests__/rt-paths.test.ts) fail the build if that pattern — or any
 * legacy `.rt` literal — reappears outside this module.
 *
 * HOME is resolved at CALL time via `process.env.HOME ?? homedir()` so tests can
 * point the whole tree at a temp dir by setting process.env.HOME before calling.
 * This also unifies the two conventions that previously coexisted (some modules
 * used homedir() at module-load time, others process.env.HOME at call time) —
 * a real divergence if the two ever differed.
 *
 * This module is also the only place allowed to know the LEGACY locations
 * (~/.rt, ~/.shepherdr): it owns the one-shot migration (migrateLegacyRtDir)
 * and the canary probe (legacyDirsPresent) that `rt verify` uses to detect
 * a machine still carrying real legacy dirs.
