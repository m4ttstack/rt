/**
 * The sops-backed secrets store: `~/.mattstack/user/secrets/<domain>.json`,
 * decrypted with the mattstack age key (lib/home/age-key.ts) via SOPS_AGE_KEY.
 * The key crosses into the sops subprocess ONLY through that env var — never
 * argv, never a file — mirroring readAgeKey's own custody rule and its
 * `.sops.yaml` creation rule for `secrets/**` (lib/home/age-key.ts). sops
 * resolves `.sops.yaml` and matches `path_regex` cwd-relative, so every sops
 * spawn pins cwd to `<mattstackHome>/user` (buildSecretsSpawnOptions) — the
 * regex, the cwd pin, and the `--filename-override` below all move together
 * or sops silently matches no rule and encrypts to the wrong recipient.
 *
 * Write idiom: stage plaintext at `~/.mattstack/rt/tmp/<domain>.<pid>.json`
 * (rt/ is gitignored — never a tracked path), fsync it, encrypt with
 * `--filename-override secrets/<domain>.json` (relative to the pinned cwd,
 * keeping the `.sops.yaml` path_regex matching even though the real input
 * lives in rt/tmp) into
 * `<target>.<pid>.tmp` (pid-qualified so two concurrent writers can't
 * unlink each other's tmp output), decrypt that tmp output and confirm the
 * newly written key round-trips — a real check that the encrypt used the
 * right recipient, not a content heuristic — and only then fsync + rename
 * it over the real target. Every staging/output-tmp path is unlinked in a
 * `finally`, so a failure never leaves plaintext at a path the user has to
 * find and delete — the original target (untouched until the rename) is
 * always the fallback. This keeps the new value out of every subprocess's
 * argv too, unlike `sops --set`, which would put it on the sops command
 * line.
 *
 * No file locking: two concurrent `rt secrets set` calls against the same
 * domain race on the same rename target (last one to rename wins, silently
 * dropping the other's merge). Acceptable for a single-operator CLI; not
 * safe for concurrent/multi-process writers.
