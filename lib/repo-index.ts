/**
 * Global repo index — tracks all known repos in state.db's kv store
 * (ns='repo-index', one row per repo: k=repoName, v=main-worktree path).
 *
 * The index is a DISPOSABLE CACHE (RT-49, collapsed into state.db by RT-50):
 * it self-populates as rt visits repos (`updateRepoIndex`, called from
 * lib/repo.ts's `getRepoIdentity`). Losing it loses nothing durable — every

 * settings key (below) as an unregistered candidate. It is not part of any
 * backup/restore story and never will be.
 *
 * ~/.mattstack/rt/repos.json is written alongside state.db purely as a
 * derived compatibility file for out-of-process rt-client consumers — see
 * repoIndexCompatPath's doc comment below.
 *
 * Provides repo discovery with worktree enumeration so commands
 * can offer pickers when run outside a git repo.

 *  - worktree-pool detection: a `.git`-less child whose OWN children include
 *    at least one `.git` dir/file is a worktree-pool folder; each qualifying
 *    grandchild becomes a candidate named `<pool>/<slot>`. The pool folder's
 *    own name is never checked against `knownNames` — Matt's convention
 *    names the pool folder after its indexed repo, so a name-first skip
 *    would silence the rule in exactly that case. The plain `knownNames`
 *    skip applies ONLY to the `.git`-bearing child branch, and only AFTER
 *    the `.git` probe decides the candidate kind.
