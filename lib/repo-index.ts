/**
 * Global repo index — tracks all known repos in state.db's kv store
 * (ns='repo-index', one row per repo: k=repoName, v=main-worktree path).
 *
 * The index is a DISPOSABLE CACHE (RT-49, collapsed into state.db by RT-50):
 * it self-populates as rt visits repos (`updateRepoIndex`, called from
 * lib/repo.ts's `getRepoIdentity`). Losing it loses nothing durable — every
 * entry regenerates the next time rt runs inside that repo — except a row
 * whose repo MOVED, which only `updateRepoIndexAsync` or `rt repos locate`
 * can re-point (see `writeIndexRow`) — and meanwhile the
 * picker still surfaces every repo reachable under the `rt.repoRoots`
 * settings key (below) as an unregistered candidate. It is not part of any
 * backup/restore story and never will be.
 *
 * ~/.mattstack/rt/repos.json is written alongside state.db purely as a
 * derived compatibility file for out-of-process rt-client consumers — see
 * repoIndexCompatPath's doc comment below.
 *
 * Provides repo discovery with worktree enumeration so commands
 * can offer pickers when run outside a git repo.
