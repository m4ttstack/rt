/**
 * In-memory stand-in for the branch-cache store (`lib/state/branch-cache.ts`)
 * for handler tests that only care about `entries`.
 *
 * RT-48: handler fakes used to be `{ cache: { entries }, flushCache, loadCache }`.
 * `ctx.cache` is now the store itself, so a fake has to answer the whole
 * BranchCacheStore surface — the map half, with no db behind it. Tests that
 * want to ASSERT persistence should use a real store over
 * `openStateDb(tempPath)` instead of this.
