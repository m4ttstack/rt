 *     later create from reusing the same name.
 *  2. (d) orphaned `creating` entries (no held lock) are scrapped before (a)
 *     evaluates existence, since an in-flight (locked) `creating` entry has
 *     no git worktree yet and must not be pruned out from under the create.
 *  3. (a) registry entries with no matching git/disk worktree are pruned.
 *  4. (b) git worktrees unknown to the registry are adopted (main/unmanaged).
 *  5. (c) every remaining registered tree's `branch` is set to git ground
 *     truth; kind/state/owner are left untouched.
 *  6. (e) duplicate branches across registered trees are left as-is —
 *     surfaced elsewhere (findByBranch / T13's list handler).
 *
 * Concurrency: this is the one registry writer that saves a WHOLE snapshot
 * taken before a long run of git awaits. Every other writer is a synchronous
 * fresh-load → mutate → save of one row, so per-tree locks are enough for them;
 * they are not enough here, because reconcile holds no lock on the trees it
 * rewrites (and taking a repo-wide one would reintroduce the coarse locking
 * this design avoids). Instead each attempt captures `registryEpoch` with its
 * snapshot and re-checks it in the same synchronous block as its save: if
 * anyone else wrote in between, the snapshot is stale and the whole pass is
 * retried against fresh state rather than overwriting them. Retries are bounded
 * — a pass that keeps losing simply skips its save and lets the next tick redo
 * it, since every correction here is derived from ground truth and idempotent.
