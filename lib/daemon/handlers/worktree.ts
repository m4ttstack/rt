/**
 * Worktree lifecycle IPC verbs (spec §3): provision, create, dispose, list,
 * freshen, adopt. Every mutation the CLI and the skills perform goes through
 * here, which is what makes the daemon the single writer of the registry.
 *
 * The verbs are thin: the intelligence lives in lib/worktree/* (create,
 * dispose guard, locks, branch naming) and lib/daemon/worktree-reconciler.ts
 * (reconcile, freshen). What this module owns is the ORDER those pieces run
 * in, which is load-bearing for provision (§7):
 *
 *   1. resolve intent and fire every registry-decidable refusal BEFORE any
 *      tree is touched — an expected "resume there?" refusal must never
 *      strand a claimed tree;
 *   2. select / create the tree;
 *   3. claim it under its lock;
 *   4. check the work branch out per the resolution matrix;
 *   5. roll back on any failure after the claim — reverted to on-deck when the
 *      tree never left its `on-deck/<name>` branch, disposable (with the
 *      failure as the reason) when it did. No limbo states.
 *
 * Handler outcomes are `{ok:true, data}` / `{ok:false, error}` with typed
 * refusal strings; daemon.ts's handleCommand does the outcome logging, so
 * nothing here logs request/response.
 *
 * Every `repoName` here (payload field, registry key, `ctx.repoIndex()`
 * lookup) is the CLI's serialized repo identity, not a display name —
 * `index[repoName]` and `loadRegistry(repoName)` only resolve because both
 * sides now key on that same identity string.
