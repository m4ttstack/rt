/**
 * Dispose guard + removal (spec §8).

 * string the reactor records as `disposableReason` and the CLI prints. The
 * order matters — cheap, local, categorical checks first, then the ones that
 * can hit the network (fetch) or someone else's coordination state (leases).
 *
 * `force` overrides guards 2-5 and never guard 1: "main" and "unmanaged" trees
 * are categorically not rt's to delete, no matter what the caller asks for.
