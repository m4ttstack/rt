/**
 * Daemon status classification.
 *
 * `daemonQuery` collapses several distinct outcomes into `null` — including the
 * case it has already proven the daemon is alive (see the socket-exists check
 * in `daemon-client.ts`, which returns null on a timed-out query rather than
 * attempting a restart). A caller that reads "no usable response" as "the
 * daemon is down" then tells the user to start a daemon that is already
 * running. This maps the raw outcome onto what is actually known.
 *
 * Below that, a second tier answers a harder question: rt.sock isn't
 * answering at all, but is the daemon actually down, or alive-and-stuck?
 * `pidAlive`/`breadcrumb`/`supervision` (Task 9's supervision-state.ts) are
 * the only signals that can tell, and per Ruling P1 (2026-08-28 p0-supervision
 * ledger) the breadcrumb FILE is the sole record a pre-state.db boot failure
 * leaves. `supervision` (the kv tier) can be absent even when `breadcrumb`
 * is present, and classification must still resolve to something useful from
 * the breadcrumb alone.
