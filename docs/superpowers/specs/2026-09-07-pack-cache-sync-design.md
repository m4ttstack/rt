# Converging Claude's plugin cache with the team clone

2026-09-07 (revised 2026-09-08 after adversarial review). MAT-410. The team
clone pulls new pack versions and the installed Claude plugin stays stale, so
pack releases silently never reach the people using them. Every claim about the
`claude` CLI below was proved by running it (2.1.263) against a fixture
directory marketplace in an isolated HOME; the probe results are in "Evidence".

## Problem

`~/.mattstack/teams/<slug>` is registered with Claude Code as a `directory`
marketplace, and the pack is installed from it as `<plugin>@<marketplace>`.
Installing copies the pack into
`~/.claude/plugins/cache/<marketplace>/<plugin>/<version>`. The MAT-405 snapshot
daemon now fast-forwards that clone every few minutes, but nothing re-reads it
into the cache. Observed on the owner's own machine when MAT-410 was filed:
clone at pack 0.5.20, installed plugin 0.5.18.

Three further facts, all verified in the code:

**`rt setup status` cannot show it.** The `pack.<pack>` row is built from
`readPackRequirements`, which finds packs by locating a `requirements.jsonc`
under the clone. acme1's pack ships none, so there is no `pack.acme1`
row at all, and the rows that do exist report `installed` with no version.

**The enable state underneath it is already wrong.** `plugins.install` enforces
the installed-never-enabled ruling by skipping the `claude plugin enable` call
for team-authored plugins. But `claude plugin install` enables the plugin by
itself: install alone into a clean HOME yields `enabledPlugins: {<id>: true}`.
The only test covering this asserts that the `enable` argv is absent, so it
stays green while the outcome is wrong.

**`rt setup apply` re-enables a pack the member deliberately turned off.**
`pluginsInstallRun` runs `claude plugin install` unconditionally, including for
plugins already present, and install on an installed-but-stale plugin flips
enablement back to `true`. So today the ruling is violated at join time and the
member's own later choice is overwritten on the next apply.

## Evidence

claude 2.1.263, isolated HOME, fixture directory marketplace with a one-skill
pack:

| Probe | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `claude plugin install <id>` into a clean HOME | version installed, `enabledPlugins[<id>] = true` |
| `claude plugin disable <id>`, bump the source version, `claude plugin update <id> -y` | version moves, `enabledPlugins[<id>]` stays `false` |
| `claude plugin update` with no prior `claude plugin marketplace update` | picks up the new version; a directory source needs no refresh step |
| `claude plugin install` on an installed-but-stale plugin | version moves **and** enablement flips back to `true` |
| `claude plugin update` when already current | exit 0, "already at the latest version" |
| `claude plugin update` for a plugin that is not installed | exit 1, stderr `Plugin "<name>" not found` |
| `claude plugin list --json --available` after a source bump | `available: []`, so it cannot detect the newer version |

Three consequences drive the whole design. The converge verb is `update`, never
`install`, because only `update` preserves the disabled state. The served
version must be read from the clone on disk, because the CLI will not report it.
And `update`'s own not-found failure is a reliable, cheap proof that a plugin is
absent, which the design uses instead of a separate installed-check.

## Alignment with the owner/member split

Ruling of 2026-09-07: only the owner writes team settings, members are
pull-only, and member daemons never push the team repo. This design sits
entirely on the member-safe side. Its trigger is the pull edge, the half of the
snapshot engine that stays alive when the push half is refused, and its only
write is to `~/.claude` on the local machine. It writes no team scope, pushes
nothing, and needs no forge write.

## Design

### Trigger: the pull that moved HEAD, from the timer and boot only

`doPull` classifies its outcomes, and exactly two mean HEAD moved:
`fast-forwarded` and `rebased`. `conflict` aborts the rebase and restores the
prior HEAD; `up-to-date` and `skipped` never move it.

`SnapshotSpec.pull` gains one optional field:

```ts
pull?: {
  intervalSec: number;
  /** Fired after a pull that moved HEAD, outside the git lock. */
  onPulled?: (outcome: "fast-forwarded" | "rebased") => Promise<void>;
};
```

`pullNow` awaits it after `withGitLock` releases:

- outside the lock, because the hook shells out to `claude` and holding the git
  lock that long would block the commit cycle;
- awaited rather than fire-and-forget, so a test that awaits `pullNow()`
  observes the converge deterministically instead of racing it.

**The push path does not fire it.** `doPushInner` calls `pullNow()` before every
push (`home-snapshot.ts:866`) to avoid diverging, not to react to content. That
pull is inside `pushInFlight`, so a converge there would delay every push by the
length of a plugin install, and any converge stall would wedge the push path on
owner machines. `pullNow` therefore takes `{ converge?: boolean }`, defaulting
to true, and `doPushInner` passes `converge: false`. Nothing is lost: the timer
pull converges the same clone within one interval.

The converging callers are the interval timer, the boot pull `init()` already
fires (so a clone that moved while the daemon was down converges at start), and
the explicit `team:pull` daemon verb.

The home spec has no `pull` field at all, so the home repo is untouched, and the
engine stays pack-agnostic: it knows only that something wants to hear about a
pull.

### Bounding the hook, so a hung `claude` cannot kill the pull loop

This is the sharpest failure mode in the design and it is specified explicitly.
`execWithTimeout` awaits its collected output unconditionally when no
`timeoutMs` is given (`probes.ts:118-122`), so a `claude` that never exits hangs
forever. `schedulePull` re-arms only in the `.finally` of `pullNow`
(`home-snapshot.ts:679-682`), so a hung hook would stop that clone's pull loop
for the life of the daemon, silently.

Two bounds, both required:

- **Per-exec:** every `claude` call the converge makes passes
  `timeoutMs: PACK_EXEC_TIMEOUT_MS` (60_000, the value and the reasoning
  `plugins.install` already uses). A timeout surfaces as exit code 124, the
  repo's existing convention, and is recorded as a `failed` entry for that pack
  with detail `timed out after 60s`. It is never recorded as success, and never
  as "not installed".
- **Per-converge:** a whole-run budget of `CONVERGE_BUDGET_MS` (120_000).
  When it is exhausted, the remaining packs are recorded as `skipped` with
  `converge budget exhausted` and the run returns. The next pull retries them.

Together these cap the hook's contribution to `pullNow` at a known bound, so
`schedulePull` always re-arms. The hook's own `catch` additionally guarantees a
throwing converge cannot turn a successful pull into a failure.

### Converge: `lib/setup/pack-cache.ts`

A new module beside `base-plugins.ts`, and for the same reason: the daemon
supervisor, the setup step and the status validator all need it, and none of
them may import a setup step.

```ts
export interface ServedPack { id: string; name: string; servedVersion: string | null }
export interface InstalledPack { id: string; version: string | null; enabled: boolean }
/** `error` is non-null only for a marketplace.json that exists and did not parse. */
export interface ServedPacks { packs: ServedPack[]; error: string | null }

/** marketplace.json plus each plugin source's plugin.json, read from the clone. */
export function readServedPacks(p: Probes, slug: string): ServedPacks

export interface ConvergeResult {
  updated: { id: string; to: string | null }[];
  installed: string[];
  current: string[];
  skipped: { id: string; reason: string }[];
  failed: { id: string; detail: string }[];
}
export async function convergePackCache(p: Probes, slug: string, log: Logger): Promise<ConvergeResult>
```

`convergePackCache` walks the same `claudeConfigDirs(p, [])` list and passes the
same `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` env as `plugins.install`, so the two agree about which
Claude installs they manage.

**The per-pack sequence, which is also the ruling's single enforcement point:**

```
update <id> -y
  exit 0                  -> it existed and is now current. Enable state untouched.
  exit != 0, "not found"  -> it did not exist:
                               install <id>
                               disable <id>        (team-authored)
  exit != 0, otherwise    -> failed, recorded with stderr
```

Deriving absence from `update`'s own not-found failure, rather than from a
separate `claude plugin list` pre-check, is what makes the never-disable-on-
uncertainty rule structural rather than a promise. `disable` runs only on the
branch where `update` proved the pack absent and `install` then created it. There
is no code path where an unreadable listing, a timeout or any other uncertainty
can reach a `disable`, because uncertainty exits through the `failed` branch.

A "not found" match is anchored to that phrasing in stderr, the way `isAlready`
is anchored today, so an unrelated failure cannot be read as absence.

`install` on a fresh pack is what delivers the 2026-09-07 ruling that a pack
added to the team after a member joined installs through the converge, disabled,
with the member opting in via Enable. It is the same three lines that serve the
join-time case.

If `resolveTool(p, "claude")` finds nothing, the converge returns a single
skipped entry naming that: a machine without Claude Code is not a daemon error.

No `claude plugin marketplace add` and no `claude plugin marketplace update`:
the marketplace is already registered by `plugins.install`, and a directory
source needs no refresh, both proved above.

### Reading what the team serves

`readServedPacks` reads `<clone>/.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` and, for each
entry, the `plugin.json` at its `source`. The failure cases are defined rather
than left to silence, because silent dropping is the exact failure this spec
exists to fix:

| Input | Result |
| --- | --- |
| file absent | `{ packs: [], error: null }`. A clone rt does not own yet is not an error, matching `readTeamMarketplace` today. |
| file unparsable | `{ packs: [], error: "<path> did not parse" }`. The team authored it; its packs must not vanish silently. The status row renders this as an `error` row. |
| entry `source` is a string | resolved relative to the clone root; its `plugin.json` `version` is the served version. |
| entry `source` is object-form (github, url) | pack listed, `servedVersion: null`. The version is not on disk to read. |
| `plugin.json` missing or unparsable | pack listed, `servedVersion: null`. |

**Null-version comparison is defined:** a pack whose served or installed version
is null is never treated as stale and never triggers an update. Unknown is not a
mismatch. It renders as `version unknown` on its row, and the converge records
it as `skipped` with that reason. This keeps an object-form source from
provoking an update loop it can never satisfy.

### The parser, shared not duplicated

`validators/tools.ts` already parses `claude plugin list --json` with a
deliberate strictness contract: any element missing a string `id` rejects the
whole payload, while a missing `enabled` normalizes to `false` rather than
rejecting. That parser moves into `pack-cache.ts` and gains `version`;
`validators/tools.ts` imports it. The contract and its tests are preserved
exactly; the change is additive.

The status row still needs the listing (to report installed version and enable
state), so the pre-check that the converge no longer performs remains where it
always was: in the read-only status path, where being unable to read it renders
an honest `error` row rather than driving a write.

### Wiring

`teamSnapshotSpec` takes `onPulled` in its opts and passes it through.
`startTeamSnapshots` supplies it and already holds everything needed: `probes`
(from `createRealProbes()`), the slug, and the per-clone child logger.

**A known environment divergence, named rather than hidden.** `claudeConfigDirs`
reads `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` from the process env. The daemon's env is launchd's,
not the user's shell, so a user who sets that variable in their shell profile
has the CLI managing one config dir and the daemon converging another. The
converge therefore logs which config dir it acted on, and the status row reports
the dir the CLI sees, so the two can be compared instead of quietly disagreeing.
Making them agree is out of scope here (it is a setting, not a fix in this lane).

### Surfacing: the pack rows

`toolRows` gains the team slug through its `opts` argument; `composePlan` has
`team.slug` in hand at the call site (`plan.ts:143`, used at `plan.ts:156`).

`packRow` is rebuilt around the union of two sources, keyed by pack name so each
pack yields exactly one row:

- packs discovered by `readPackRequirements` (whose `.error` row is preserved
  unchanged), and
- packs the team marketplace serves, which is how acme1 gets a row at all.

| Condition | Status | Detail |
| --- | --- | --- |
| marketplace.json unparsable | `error` | `<path> did not parse` |
| not installed | `missing` | installed by Install (plugins.install) |
| installed, versions match, not enabled | `ready` | `<v> installed, not enabled ... claude plugin enable <id>`, plus the restart caveat |
| installed, versions match, enabled | `ready` | `<v> installed and enabled`, plus the restart caveat |
| installed, versions differ | `needs-you` | `installed <a>, team serves <b>` |
| either version unknown | `ready` | `<v> installed, served version unknown` |

**The restart caveat sits on the converged row, not the stale one.** On a stale
row the cache itself still holds the old version, so a restart changes nothing
and the caveat would be actively misleading. It belongs where the cache has
already moved and only the running process is behind: `a Claude session started
before this version landed uses the old cache until it restarts`.

A disabled team pack is `ready`, not `needs-you`: under the ruling that is the
correct state, and the row's job is to name the one command that turns it on
(R1's "a visible statement of the one command that enables the pack"). A stale
row is `needs-you` with the existing `rt setup pack` action, because the daemon
converges automatically, so a row still stale when a human reads it means the
automatic path did not work and a person does need to act.

### The install path

`plugins.install` stops calling `claude plugin install` unconditionally and
calls the same `pack-cache.ts` per-pack sequence instead, so the enable rule and
the update-not-install rule live in exactly one place. For trusted plugins the
`enable` call follows as it does today; for team-authored plugins it stays
skipped, and the `disable` fires only on the proved-absent branch.

This is what stops `rt setup apply` re-enabling a pack the member deliberately
turned off: an already-installed plugin now takes the `update` path, which
preserves enablement, and never the `install` path, which does not.

A failed `disable` is logged and named in the step detail but does not fail the
step, matching the existing best-effort posture for `enable`: an otherwise
successful install should not fail over enable-state bookkeeping.

### Logging

The converge logs one domain event per team clone per converging pull, naming
what moved and which config dir it acted on, at `info`; nothing when there was
nothing to do. Failures and timeouts log at `warn` with `{ err }`.

The hook's own `catch` is the logging seam for this path, and the spec says so
because the usual one does not apply: `handleCommand` covers daemon commands,
and a timer-driven pull is not one. Nothing below that catch may swallow an
error silently.

### No new setting

`rt.teamSnapshot.enabled` already disables the whole engine including its pulls,
so a kill switch for the converge exists. A second key would add a registry
entry and a second way to express one intent.

## Testing

**Unit, always run.** The converge and step tests run against a temp HOME with a
fake `exec` that models the proved claude semantics by writing a real
`settings.json` and `installed_plugins.json` (install writes `enabled: true`,
disable writes `false`, update leaves enablement alone and moves the version).
Assertions read those files. The outcome is therefore literal, not a stand-in:
the existing argv-absence test in `steps-c.test.ts` is replaced, because an argv
assertion cannot fail when the outcome is wrong, which is precisely how the
current defect stayed green.

Cases that must be covered because the design turns on them: a converge with no
version change issues no `update`; a stale pack updates and keeps its disabled
state; a served-but-absent pack installs and ends disabled; an `update` failure
that is not "not found" never reaches `install` or `disable`; a per-exec timeout
records `failed` and never `not installed`; the budget cap returns and lets the
pull loop re-arm; and a push-path pull fires no converge.

**Contract e2e, opt-in.** `RT_CLAUDE_PLUGIN_E2E=1` runs the real `claude` binary
against a fixture directory marketplace in an isolated HOME and asserts the
behaviors the design rests on: install enables, disable then update preserves
disabled, update moves the version from a directory source, and update on an
uninstalled plugin exits non-zero with "not found". This is the test that fails
loudly if claude's behavior changes. It follows the house pattern for a test
needing a real external dependency (`sdm-browser-login.test.ts`): env-gated and
named, never silently skipped on a missing binary.

Honest limitation: no CI workflow installs `claude`, so CI cannot catch a claude
behavior change. The VM pass is where that assertion becomes a release gate, and
MAT-402's planned `team-pack` fixture and `assert-team.sh` blocks are the vehicle.
That work stays in MAT-402's lane.

## Acceptance

- A member whose team clone fast-forwards onto a new pack version ends with the
  new version in `~/.claude/plugins/cache`, with no command typed.
- The pack's enable state is the same before and after that converge.
- A pack added to the team after a member joined installs on the next converging
  pull and ends **not** enabled.
- A joiner who completes setup ends with the team pack installed and not
  enabled, asserted on the resulting settings files rather than on argv.
- A member who enables the pack, then runs `rt setup apply`, still has it enabled
  afterwards.
- `rt setup status` shows a row per team-served pack carrying its installed
  version, names the served version when they differ, and states the restart
  caveat on the row where the cache has already moved.
- A pull that moves HEAD without changing any pack version runs no
  `claude plugin update`.
- A `claude` that never exits cannot stop a clone's pull loop: the converge
  returns within its budget and `schedulePull` re-arms.

## Out of scope

The enable verb and the Done-screen line from R1 (this ships the row and the
command text, not a one-shot verb), the VM fixture and its assertions (MAT-402),
reconciling the daemon's `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` with the shell's, and any change to
how packs are published.
