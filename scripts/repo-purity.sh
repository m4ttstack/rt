# rt is a public, general-purpose developer tool. Nothing about any particular
# employer, customer, or internal system belongs in it -- not in code, not in
# fixtures, not in docs, not in plans. This sweeps everything git tracks, so
# program artifacts and design documents are held to the same line as source.
#
# The bar exists because it was crossed: rt was public for six months carrying
# an internal GitLab host, real ticket ids and titles, internal repo names, and
# two named customers wired to database resource names in test fixtures. A word
# list cannot certify what it was never told to look for, so add to it whenever
# a new term shows up rather than assuming this list is complete.
#
# Run bare from anywhere: scripts/repo-purity.sh. Exit 0 = clean.
